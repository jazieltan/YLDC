MS Office apps like Word, Powerpoint, Excel, etc. have got so many features nowadays that it takes weeks of classes to learn the ins and outs of a single product (almost as many features as text editors). Then there’s the feature that most people aren’t so much a fan of, the price tag. Having said that, do you wish to know some great free Microsoft Office alternatives to make your tasks easier?

##  Google Docs

Google is known for its omnipresence in all things technology, there are few places Google hasn’t touched, and the office isn’t one of them. Google’s own set of web apps can be used as the best alternative to Microsoft Office apps as they are available for free and their cloud-based nature doesn’t need you to go through a tedious installation process.

Google Docs online office suite comprises of a word processor (Docs), a presentation app (Slides), a spreadsheet (Sheets). Apart from these primary office apps, Google Drawings, Forms, are also a part of the free office suite.

Google’s office suite apps can be accessed without any cost from any location on the globe, all you need is a Google account and an active internet connection. However, the biggest advantage can be a deal breaker for the users having a scarcity of internet. Although there is an official extension that enables offline mode, it only works for the files stored on your Google Drive.

Google Docs supports simple export to industry standard document formats such as Microsoft ‘docx’, PDF, and several others. Similar is the case of other Google office apps like Sheets and Slides. Google Sheets now includes a feature where you can create pie charts and bar graphs for a given data just by typing the description into a text box.

You can upload files from your device or directly edit the files stored on your Google Drive. Google office apps allow the sharing of documents privately with friends, or even publicly. And in addition to the sharing, you can even invite people to edit with you in real-time collaboration.

## Libre Office

 LibreOffice was forked from OpenOffice a while back for some political reasons. Suitable for all intents and purposes, they’re more or less the same thing with the exception that the community followed the LibreOffice fork and OpenOffice just hasn’t seen as much development since.

LibreOffice is a very feature-rich free MS Office alternative suite if you want something that installs on your computer and works without an internet connection. In terms of cost-effectiveness, it’s pretty hard to beat. It has a few quirks, like need to change the default document formats to Microsoft Office formats. But apart from that, this free office software is an excellent choice for anyone that doesn’t require the bells and whistles of a commercial product.
